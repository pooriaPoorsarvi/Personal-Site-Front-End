      <h4>Machine learning paper</h4>
      <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">One of the papers worked, was the use of machine learning inorder to find code vulnerabilities by a Neural Network model. This model used RNN and text processing and the paper can be found <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417419308735">here</a>.</p>
